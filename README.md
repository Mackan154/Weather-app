# Weather-app

Weather-APP is a web application that allows you to check the current weather in any city worldwide.

To use the application, you'll need to enter the name of a city in the search field and then press the "Search" button. Upon navigating to a new page, you will receive information such as a description of the current weather at the location, including the temperature in degrees, lowest and highest temperature of the day, wind speed, and humidity. Additionally, you can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units. If you enter the name of a non-existent city, an error message will be displayed.
